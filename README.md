# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single-page React app that allows users to book, edit, and cancel interviews with a selection of interviewers. Available appointments are displayed dynamically.

## Learning Outcome
* Building react components in isolation, testing them, then implementing them into the application with E2E testing
* Passing data between components using props and state
* Retrieving API data and rendering it within components
* Conditionally rendering live visual state of a single-page app
